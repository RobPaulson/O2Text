API for sending text messages with O2

As an O2 customer you'll find that you have 500 free webtexts to use each month.  Usually that requires logging into the O2 website directly.  Using O2Text you can easily include text message alerts into your programs.

    > var result = o2.SendTextMessage("08661231234", "Your message here");
